                    The Christian Café movement started through the passion and vision of
                    dedicated believers who desired to create a space for spiritual
                    connection, worship, and community.
                    This initiative was built on faith, love, and service, uniting
                    believers across branches and generations under one purpose — to
                    glorify God and uplift others through fellowship and worship.
